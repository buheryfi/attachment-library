### Set-up and Use

You must create a custom text user field that will store data about your bookmarks.  Grab the field key and enter it into the app when prompted during installation.  That's it for set up! 

The app is available on the ticket and new ticket pages.  Once you open a ticket, you can see the app in it's default state.  Click on one of the three buttons to see the app in action (page, library, external).

On the library tab, you'll see any attachments that have already been added to your library.  You can select them to add to the page as an embedded image or plain link, preview the items, or remove the items from your library.

On the page tab, you'll see any attachments that have been added to the ticket.  You can select them to add to your library, preview the items, add them to the page as an embedded image, or add a link to the item.

On the external tab, you'll be able to add attachments hosted outside of Zendesk to your library.  You'll just need to include the URL (https only), a name for the item, and the item type (image or text).
or you can enter the URL for an attachment in the external tab
then, after they're saved, they'll appear in your library tab
